# Overview

gokrazy packs your Go application(s) into an SD card image for the Raspberry Pi
3 or 4 which — aside from the Linux kernel and proprietary Raspberry Pi
bootloader — only contains Go software.

The motivation is that [@stapelberg](https://github.com/stapelberg)
spends way more time on C software and their various issues than he
would like. Hence, he is going Go-only where feasible.

# Usage

## Installation

[Install the latest Go version](https://golang.org/dl/) if you haven’t already.

Create a directory for this gokrazy instance and initialize a Go module:

```
INSTANCE=gokrazy/hello
mkdir -p ~/${INSTANCE?}
cd ~/${INSTANCE?}
go mod init hello
```

Then, install `gokr-packer`:
```
go install github.com/gokrazy/tools/cmd/gokr-packer@latest
```

## Overwriting an SD card for the Raspberry Pi 3 or 4

To re-partition and overwrite the SD card `/dev/sdx`, use:

```
gokr-packer -overwrite=/dev/sdx github.com/gokrazy/hello
```

Then, put the SD card into your Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 and power it up! Once the
Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 has booted (takes about 10 seconds), you should be able to
reach the gokrazy web interface at the URL which `gokr-packer` printed.

Under the hood, `gokr-packer`…

1. …packed the latest [firmware](https://github.com/gokrazy/firmware)
   and [kernel](https://github.com/gokrazy/kernel) binaries into the
   boot file system.

2. …built the specified Go packages using `go install` and packed all
   their binaries into the `/user` directory of the root file system.

3. …created a minimal gokrazy init program which supervises all
   binaries (i.e. restarts them when they exit).

## Updating your installation

To update gokrazy, including the firmware and kernel binaries, use:
```
go get -u github.com/gokrazy/tools/cmd/gokr-packer
go get -u github.com/gokrazy/gokrazy
go get -u github.com/gokrazy/kernel
go get -u github.com/gokrazy/firmware
go get -u github.com/gokrazy/rpi-eeprom
```

To update your gokrazy installation (running on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4),
use:
```
GOKRAZY_UPDATE=http://gokrazy:mysecretpassword@gokrazy/ gokr-packer github.com/gokrazy/hello
```

# SD card contents

gokrazy uses the following partition table:

num | size   | purpose                | file system
----|--------|------------------------|---------------
1   | 100 MB | boot (kernel+firmware) | FAT16B
2   | 500 MB | root2 (gokrazy+apps)   | SquashFS
3   | 500 MB | root3 (gokrazy+apps)   | SquashFS
4   | rest   | permanent data         | ext4

The two root partitions are used alternatingly (to avoid modifying the
currently active file system) when updating.

If you’d like to store permanent data (i.e. data which will not be
overwritten on the next update), you’ll need to create an ext4 file
system on the last partition. If your SD card is `/dev/sdx`, use
`mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdx4`. After you successfully created the new filesystem
on the forth partition, gokrazy will automatically mount the filesystem
under `/perm` during startup. Use this mount directory to store your permanent data.

# Customization

## Changing program behavior for gokrazy

`gokr-packer` sets the “gokrazy” [build
tag](https://golang.org/pkg/go/build/#hdr-Build_Constraints) for
conditional compilation.

You can find an example commit which implements a gokrazy-specific
controller that triggers the main program logic every weekday at 10:00
at https://github.com/stapelberg/zkj-nas-tools/commit/6f90ace35981f78dcd66d611269f17f37ce4b4ef

## Changing init behavior

Assuming the application you’d like to create on gokrazy lives in the repository
`github.com/stapelberg/mediaserver`, this is how you can make gokrazy dump the
generated init package’s source:

```
mkdir -p $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/stapelberg/mediaserver/cmd/init
gokr-packer \
  -overwrite_init=$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/stapelberg/mediaserver/cmd/init/init.go \
  github.com/gokrazy/hello
```

(Note that the package must result in a binary called “init”.)

Then, edit the `github.com/stapelberg/mediaserver` package to your
liking. When done, pack an image with your own init package:
```
gokr-packer \
  -init_pkg=github.com/stapelberg/mediaserver/cmd/init \
  -overwrite=/dev/sdx \
  github.com/gokrazy/hello
```

# Documentation

[gokrazy.org](https://gokrazy.org) uses [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for creating and generating the website.
You can find the hugo install instructions here: [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
With hugo you can write documentation in Markdown and generate a static website from it.

The `website` subdirectory is hugo’s root directory. In order to preview the
documentation or to re-generate the website, switch the directory to `website`.

To preview the website, run the hugo webserver:

```bash
hugo serve
```

Generate the website:

```bash
hugo
```

The updated website content will be stored in the `./docs` directory.
Do not update anything here manually.

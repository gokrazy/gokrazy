# Overview

With gokrazy, you can deploy your Go programs as appliances to a Raspberry Pi or
PC ([→ supported platforms](https://gokrazy.org/platforms/)).

For a long time, we were unhappy with having to care about security issues and
Linux distribution maintenance on our various Raspberry Pis.

Then, we had a crazy idea: what if we got rid of memory-unsafe languages and all
software we don’t strictly need?

Turns out this is feasible. gokrazy is the result.

# Documentation

[gokrazy.org](https://gokrazy.org) uses [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for creating and generating the website.
You can find the hugo install instructions here: [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
With hugo you can write documentation in Markdown and generate a static website from it.

The `website` subdirectory is hugo’s root directory. In order to preview the
documentation or to re-generate the website, switch the directory to `website`.

To preview the website, run the hugo webserver:

```bash
hugo serve
```

Generate the website:

```bash
hugo
```

The updated website content will be stored in the `./docs` directory.
Do not update anything here manually.

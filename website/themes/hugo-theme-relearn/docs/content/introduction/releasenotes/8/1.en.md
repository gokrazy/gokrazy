## 8.1.0 (2025-10-05) {#8-1-0}

### Change

- {{% badge style="change" %}}Change{{% /badge %}} The [`children` shortcode](shortcodes/children) has learned to show its children in a nice card layout.

  This required to deprecate the `containerstyle` and `style` parameter in favor of the new `type` parameter. Your build will succeed as before but will give you detailed warnings how to migrate your old settings to the new for each occurance.

   If you haven't set `containerstyle` or `style` no changes are necessary. If you used

  - `containerstyle=ul` or `style=li` now use `type=tree`
  - `style=h*` now use `type=list`
  - any other `containerstyle` or `style` now use `type=flat`

  If you want to use the new card layout, use `type=card`.

- {{% badge style="change" %}}Change{{% /badge %}} The `externalLinkTarget` config option has changed its default from `_blank` to `_self` causing external links by default to be opened in the same tab.

  If you want to get back to the previous behavior of opening external links in a new tab, set `externalLinkTarget='_blank'` in your `hugo.toml`.

### New

- {{% badge style="new" %}}New{{% /badge %}} The theme now supports cards with the [`card` shortcode](shortcodes/card) and the corresponding [`cards` shortcode](shortcodes/cards).

  See them in action on the [shortcodes overview page](shortcodes).

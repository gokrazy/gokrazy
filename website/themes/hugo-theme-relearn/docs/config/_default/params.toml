# Used color variants.
# Default: 'auto'
# This sets one or more color variants, available to your readers to choose
# from. You can
# - set a single value eg. 'zen-light'
# - an array like [ 'neon', 'learn' ]
# - an array with options like [ { identifier = 'neon' },{ identifier = 'learn' } ]
# The last form allows to set further options for each variant.
# The `identifier` is mandatory. You can also set `name` which overrides the
# value displayed in the variant selector.
# If the array has more than one entry, a variant selector
# is shown in the lower part of the menu. The first entry in the array is the
# default variant, used for first time visitors.
# The theme ships with the following variants: 'relearn-bright',
# 'relearn-light', 'relearn-dark', 'zen-light', 'zen-dark', 'neon', 'learn',
# 'blue', 'green', 'red'. In addition you can use auto mode variants. See the

# running. Also some proxies dislike this optimization.

# Avoid generator meta tags.
# Default: false
# Set this to true if you want to disable generation for generator meta tags

# meta tag into your home page anyways.

# may not function correctly anymore.

# to console output due to false negatives. You can turn off the checks
# for individual referenced addresses by defining regular expressions here.

# Adapter for the search engine.
# Default: 'lunr'

#    the page structure, `menu` in case it should generate a tree from a
#    defined menu, `custom` for arbitrary HTML snippets or `divider` for a
#    horizontal ruler.
# - `identifier` is mandatory. In case of `type=page`, anything can be used,
#    in case of `type=menu` the `identifier` key must be identical to the
#    key of the menu definition.
# - `main`, boolean. If `true`, the first tree level is spaced more generous

#    from the menu `title` according to Hugo's documentation and if not set
#    from the menu `name` and if this is not set form the page's `linkTitle`.
# - `pageRef`, optional. In case of `type=page` this is the starting page's
#    path. If not set, the home page will be used.
# - `elements`, optional. In case of `type=custom` the list of elements to
#    display. The theme shipps with the following predefined snippets which
#    all accept the `icon` parameter to overwrite the default icon
#    - languageswitcher: will display the language switcher

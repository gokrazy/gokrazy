## Prep: pick a supported device

Currently, the Raspberry Pi 4 B is the recommended platform for
using gokrazy, but you can find
other <a href="/platforms/">supported and upcoming platforms</a>.

## Prep: Install Go

If you don‚Äôt already have Go installed, <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">install the latest Go version</a>.

## Prep: Install the gok CLI

Now that you have a working Go installation, install the <code>gok</code> command line tool (CLI):

```bash
go install github.com/gokrazy/tools/cmd/gok@main
```

## Step 1: Insert an SD card

Run `watch -d1 ls -l '/dev/disk/by-id/*'` (see the [permanent data section](https://gokrazy.org/userguide/permanent-data/section) for macOS instructions)
and insert an SD card. Copy the highlighted device name:

<script id="asciicast-G0PosAYGvUSnB3htMpLIz0p68" src="https://asciinema.org/a/G0PosAYGvUSnB3htMpLIz0p68.js" async></script>

In this example, we‚Äôll assume the SD card is accessible as <code>/dev/sdx</code>.

## Step 2: Create a gokrazy instance and overwrite an SD card with gokrazy

Create a directory for this gokrazy instance:

```bash
gok new
# creates an instance named ‚Äúhello‚Äù in --parent_dir default directory ~/gokrazy
# alternatively, to use a different instance name: gok -i myname new
```

If you‚Äôre curious, you can run `gok edit` to open the generated `config.json` in
your editor.

To overwrite the entire SD card <code>/dev/sdx</code> with a build of this
gokrazy installation, use:

```bash
gok overwrite --full /dev/sdx
```

The following packages are included in newly created instances by default:

* github.com/gokrazy/fbstatus
* github.com/gokrazy/hello
* github.com/gokrazy/serial-busybox

The gokrazy packer builds each specified Go program
(e.g. `github.com/gokrazy/hello`) in a separate build directory, each with its
own `go.mod` file. See [Working with Go modules](/development/modules/) for more
details.

This is what the above `gok` commands look like in action:

<script id="asciicast-Va7hPXCP1BKCt4DX0wRup52Bl" src="https://asciinema.org/a/Va7hPXCP1BKCt4DX0wRup52Bl.js" async></script>

If your applications need to store persistent data, unplug and re-plug the SD card, then create a file system using e.g.:

	mkfs.ext4 /dev/disk/by-partuuid/60c24cc1-f3f9-427a-8199-4f9f2cab0004

To boot gokrazy, plug the SD card into a supported device (see https://gokrazy.org/platforms/)


Build complete!

To interact with the device, gokrazy provides a web interface reachable at:

	http://gokrazy:<automatically-generated-random-password>@hello/

In addition, the following Linux consoles are set up:

	1. foreground Linux framebuffer console on HDMI

```

</details>

It is safe to unplug your SD card once <code>gok</code> returns.

## Step 3: Boot gokrazy

After booting from this SD card, your device will:

- display system status on the monitor connected via HDMI, if any
- obtain an IP address for hostname ‚Äúgokrazy‚Äù via DHCP (IPv4) and SLAAC (IPv6)
- synchronize the clock using NTP
- expose a password-authenticated web interface on private IP addresses<br>
  (each instance gets its own password in the `Update` ‚Üí `HTTPPassword` key of its `config.json`, see `gok edit`)
- supervise all installed programs (only the hello world program in this example)

To interact with your device, you can:

1. Open the gokrazy web interface in your browser (easiest option)
1. Attach a serial console (see below)
1. Use the [breakglass](https://github.com/gokrazy/breakglass) package to start an interactive SSH session. `gok new` sets it up by default.

Congratulations! üéâ You now have a working gokrazy installation!

Next, see the [Configuration guide](/userguide/) for details on how to use other
programs.

## Optional: Using the serial console

See also: [Configuration ‚Üí Instance Config Reference ‚Üí
SerialConsole](/userguide/instance-config/#serialconsole)

If you prefer the serial console, you can optionally connect a serial adapter to
the Raspberry Pi and remove the `"SerialConsole": "disabled"` line from your gokrazy
instance‚Äôs `config.json` to make the primary Linux console end up on the serial
console.

When pressing <code>Enter</code> on the serial console, gokrazy will
interactively start either:

1. `/tmp/serial-busybox/ash` (provided by the [serial-busybox](https://github.com/gokrazy/serial-busybox) package)
1. `/perm/sh`, if present (supplied by you, the user)

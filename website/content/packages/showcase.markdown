## Successfully tested

The following third-party programs have been successfully used with gokrazy
but might require additional setup:

### Prometheus

[**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/) is a monitoring and alerting system
built on a time series database.

The [**Prometheus node exporter**](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)

See also [Available packages ‚Üí MinIO](/packages/minio/).

### The relax switch

[The relax switch](https://github.com/drio/relaxswitch) is a gokrazy appliance
to enhance your bathroom experience. A friend of mine had a hilarious idea:
having a dedicated switch in your bathroom that, when switched, would play a
90s relaxing song. The original prototype ran on top of Raspbian OS, but
gokrazy is a much better fit for this project. You wire a smart relay to your
switch. The switch talks MQTT. When the person turns on the switch, the service
running on the Pi plays a 90s relaxing song. When they turn off the switch the
music go off. Simple and relaxing.

## No Go software for your idea?

You can prototype your idea by temporarily using existing software to close the
gap. See <a href="/prototyping/">Prototyping</a>.

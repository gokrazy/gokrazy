I like to periodically back up all scans from my [scan2drive
appliance](/packages/showcase/) to my PC. The PC is backed up as well, so that
automatically distributes my scans to multiple machines in case one of them
fails.

A convenient way to set up an efficient partial or full backup of a gokrazy
device’s permanent data partition is to use [the gokrazy rsync
daemon](https://github.com/gokrazy/rsync). This article walks you through how I
have set up my backup, but many variants are possible to cater to different
requirements.

(You don’t typically need backups of your gokrazy device’s root partition
because it can be built reproducibly any time using Go.)

## Step 1. Configure the gokrazy rsync daemon {#configure}

In your gokrazy instance directory (see [Quickstart](/quickstart/) if you don’t
have one yet), create a [package flag config file](/userguide/package-config/)
to start gokrazy rsync as a daemon:

```shell
mkdir -p flags/github.com/gokrazy/rsync/cmd/gokr-rsyncd
cat > flags/github.com/gokrazy/rsync/cmd/gokr-rsyncd/flags.txt <<'EOT'
--gokr.config=/etc/gokr-rsyncd.toml
--daemon
EOT
```

In the daemon config file, configure an authorized SSH listener and which rsync modules to serve:

```shell
mkdir -p extrafiles/github.com/gokrazy/rsync/cmd/gokr-rsyncd/etc
cat > extrafiles/github.com/gokrazy/rsync/cmd/gokr-rsyncd/etc/gokr-rsyncd.toml <<'EOT'
dont_namespace = true 
[[listener]]
  [listener.authorized_ssh]
    address = "scan2drive.lan:22873"
    authorized_keys = "/etc/gokr-rsyncd.authorized_keys"
[[module]]
  name = "scans"
  path = "/perm/scans"
EOT
```

Finally, create the authorized keys file that determines who can access the rsync daemon:

```shell
cat > extrafiles/github.com/gokrazy/rsync/cmd/gokr-rsyncd/etc/gokr-rsyncd.authorized_keys <<'EOT'
ssh-ed25519 […] michael@midna
EOT
```

## Step 2. Install the gokrazy rsync daemon {#install}

Include the gokrazy rsync daemon `gokr-rsyncd` in your gokr-packer invocation,
for example:

```shell
gokr-packer \
  -update=yes \
  -serial_console=disabled \
  github.com/gokrazy/fbstatus \
  github.com/gokrazy/hello \
  github.com/gokrazy/serial-busybox \
  github.com/gokrazy/rsync/cmd/gokr-rsyncd
```

## Step 3. Configure SSH from the backup machine {#ssh}

On your PC (not the gokrazy instance), add an SSH configuration stanza to your
`~/.ssh/config` to configure the custom port (22873 for ssh+rsync) and which
passwordless identity file to use (for the [cron job in step 4](#cron)):

```text
Host scan2drive-backup
    Hostname scan2drive.lan
    Port 22873
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_scan2drivebackup
```

Now you should be able to run rsync via SSH as usual:

```shell
rsync -av -e ssh rsync://scan2drive-backup/scans/ ~/scan2drive-backup/
```

## Step 4. Configure a daily cron job {#cron}


First, install [the `rsync-prom` tool](https://github.com/stapelberg/rsyncprom)
to monitor your periodic transfer with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/):

```shell
go install github.com/stapelberg/rsyncprom/cmd/rsync-prom@latest
```

Then wrap the above rsync command in an rsync-prom invocation in a shell script called `scan2drive-backup-sync.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
SSH_AUTH_SOCK= ~/go/bin/rsync-prom --instance="scan2drive@midna" \
  rsync -av -e ssh rsync://scan2drive-backup/scans/ ~/scan2drive-backup/
```

Finally, run `crontab -e` and run the script at your convenience, like so:

```
30 07 * * * /home/michael/scan2drive-backup-sync.sh
```
